Python Structure:
"Source Code" > Compiler > "Byte Code" > interpreter(Python Virtual Mechine) > Machine Language

Compiler: Your source code will be converted into mechine code(binary code)
interpreter language: means you have set of instruction, your interpreter will read the instruction or code one by one
PVM : Python is using PVM (Python Virtual Mechine) similar like JVM in Java
